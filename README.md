# Problem Statement

Investigate the relationship between the number of cylinders, engine displacement, and horsepower. Do cars with more cylinders tend to have higher horsepower? How does engine displacement affect horsepower? Compare and contrast the characteristics of automobiles based on their country or region of origin. Do cars from different regions have significantly different MPG, engine characteristics, or weight?

# Key Insights 

1. 4-cylinder engines are most common, followed by 8-cylinders and 6-cylinders.

2. The most common horsepower range is between 60 to 110 horsepower.

3. The majority of cars in the dataset are from the USA (62.6%).

4. Cars with more cylinders tend to have higher engine displacement and horsepower.

5. There are positive correlations between cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and weight.

6. Cars from Europe and Japan tend to have higher fuel efficiency (MPG) on average, while cars from the USA exhibit more variability in MPG.

 # Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into various aspects of automobiles. It reveals patterns in MPG, engine characteristics, and weight, and it highlights how these attributes vary based on the number of cylinders and the region of origin. These insights can be useful for both automotive enthusiasts and industry professionals in understanding the relationships between these variables and making informed decisions related to automobile design, manufacturing, and market strategies.
